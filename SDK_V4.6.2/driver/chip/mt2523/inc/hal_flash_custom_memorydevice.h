 [README , VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE]
 --------------------------------
 After user configured this C header file, not only C compiler compile it but
 also auto-gen tool parse user's configure setting.
 Here are recommend configure convention to make both work fine.

 1. All configurations in this file form as #define MACRO_NAME MACRO_VALUE format.
    Note the #define must be the first non-space character of a line

 2. To disable the optional configurable item. Please use // before #define,
    for example: //#define MEMORY_DEVICE_TYPE

 3. Please don't use #if , #elif , #else , #endif conditional macro key word here.
    Such usage might cause compile result conflict with auto-gen tool parsing result.
    Auto-Gen tool will show error and stop.
    3.1.  any conditional keyword such as #if , #ifdef , #ifndef , #elif , #else detected.
          execpt this #ifndef __CUSTOM_MEMORYDEVICE__
    3.2.  any duplicated MACRO_NAME parsed. For example auto-gen tool got
          2nd MEMORY_DEVICE_TYPE macro value.

 Step 3: Define the clock frequency of EMI and SFI

         By default, the highest EMI speed that can be supported by memory will be used
         (define EMI_CLK to be DEFAULT).
         By specifying EMI_CLK to be ¡§104M¡¨, ¡§52M¡¨, ¡§166M¡¨, or ¡§200M¡¨ can force EMI/memory to be configured
         running at 104MHz, 52MHz, 166MHz, or 200MHz for special purpose.
         Please note that this feature is only available on MT6253D and MT6276! All other chip must set to
         DEFAULT configuration.
         Available EMI_CLK configurations are:
         MT6253D: 104M, 52M, DEFAULT
         MT6276: 166M, 200M, DEFAULT
         other: DEFAULT

         For SFI, the highest SFI speed that can be supported by memory will be used by default
         (define SFI_CLK to be DEFAULT)
         By specifying SFI_CLK to be "130M", "104M" or "78M" can force SFI to be configured running
         at 130MHz, 104MHz or78MHz for special purpose.
         Please note that this feature is only available for platforms which support Serial Flash!

@par Overview
  - Example project description
    - This project is a reference application to use the AES APIs for
      encryption
    /decryption, including these modes.
    - CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
    - ECB (Electronic CodeBook)
    - The application does not require FreeRTOS.
  - Results
    - The calculation output is collected in a log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7682 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - This example project will output logs via HDK USB (CON5) to PC. Please
      connect a micro USB cable from a PC to CON5 port, install the mbed
      serial driver, and launch Tera terminal in PC for logging as below.
      - Require a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of PC and
        micro-B USB of the LinkIt 7687 HDK development board. For more
        information about type-A plug and micro-B plug, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Install the mbed serial driver as instructed at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refere to the installing the LinkIt 7687 HDK
        drivers on Microsoft Windows section of the LinkIt 7687 HDK user
        guides under [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - A serial tool for UART logging is required, such as Tera terminal.
        Please refer to the installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows
        section of get startedguide under [sdk_root]/doc folder for more
        information.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with the command, "./build.sh mt7682_hdk
    aes_encrypt_decrypt_data" from the SDK root folder and download the bin
    file to LinkIt 7682 development board.
  - Connect your board to the PC with a micro USB cable.
  - Run the example. The result of its CBC/ECB encryption/decryption is
    displayed in the log.

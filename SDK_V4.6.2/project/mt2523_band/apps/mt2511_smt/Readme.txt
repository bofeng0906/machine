@par Overview

This application contains an sample which demonstrates how to obtain sensor data from physical sensors and virtual sensors on sensor DTB and sensor algorithm library. The sensor data transfer to Android smart phone via BT connection.

This sample describes how to use sensor subsys SDK API and BT API
  - Subscribe a type of sensor data and wait updated sensor data in registered callback function
  - Unsubscribe a type of sensor data
  - Create a BT SPP connection in server mode
  - Send sensor data to smart phone via BT SPP connection

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This sample runs on sensor DTB attached to MT7687
  - iot_ea1_demo.apk runs on Android smart phone
  - Must connect the antenna to MT7687 for BT transmission

@par Directory contents

  - apps/iot_ea1/iot_ea1_demo.apk               Demo app to show sensor data on Android smrat phone
  - apps/iot_ea1/inc/FreeRTOSConfig.h           FreeRTOS configuration file

  - apps/iot_ea1/src/syscalls.c                 Syscall funcitons

@par Prepare the demo

  - Prepare an Android smart phone and install iot_ea1_demo.apk on it

@par Run the demo

  - Build source code of this demo application
    - in source tree root folder and enter build command : ./build.sh iot_ea1
  - Download this demo application to MT7687 by IoT_Tool(flash tool)
  - Bluetooth pairing between Android smart phone and MT7687
  - Launch iot_ea1_demo app on Android smart phone
    - iot_ea1_demo app show bluetooth devices list
    - Press MT7687 bluetooth device item (MT7687 bluetooth device name is "MT7687_HDK") on iot_ea1_demo app
    - Receive sensor data from MT7687 after few seconds
  - Observe physical sensor data changing on iot_ea1_demo app
    - Move MT7687 for accelerometer data changing
    - Rotate MT7687 for gyroscope data changing
    - Move MT7687 for magnetic field data changing
    - Upstairs or downstairs with MT7687 for pressure data changing
    - Cover proximity sensor for proximity data changing
  - Observe virtual sensor data changing on iot_ea1_demo app
    - Walk with MT7687 for pedometer data changing
    - Stand, sit or lie with MT7687 for activity data changing
    - Shake MT7687 for gesture data changing

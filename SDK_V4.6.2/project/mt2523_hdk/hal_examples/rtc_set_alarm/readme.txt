@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example is a reference application to use RTC API to control the
      RTC module on the MT2523 HDK, including set time, get time, set alarm
      and enable alarm functions.
    - This example does not require FreeRTOS.
  - Results
    - The alarm setting and result are printed in the log.

@par Hardware and Software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - HDK swicthes, pin configuration
    - N/A.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a type-A to micro-B USB cable
      to the PC from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data: 8 bits, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with a command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    rtc_set_alarm bl" under the SDK root folder and download the binary file
    to MediaTek LinkIt MT2523 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable and specify
    the port on Tera terminal corresponding to "mbed Serial Port".
  - Run the example. The log will show the current time and alarm time, and
    the result displayed in the log "---RTC example end---" indicates a
    successful alarm setting.

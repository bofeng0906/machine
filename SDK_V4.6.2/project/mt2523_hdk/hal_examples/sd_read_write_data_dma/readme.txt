@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example is a reference application to demonstrate how to read data
      from the SD card or write data to the SD card in the DMA mode (MCU
      mode).
    - This example does not require FreeRTOS.
  - Results
    - The result is in the system log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - Connect J1001.2 to J1001.3;
    - Connect J1002.2 to J1002.3;
    - Connect J1003.2 to J1003.3;
    - Connect J1004.2 to J1004.3;
    - Connect J1005.2 to J1005.3;
    - Connect J1006.2 to J1006.3;
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a type-A to micro-B USB cable
      to the PC from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data: 8 bits, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with a command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    sd_read_write_data_dma" from the SDK root folder and download the binary
    file to LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect the pins as described in "HDK switches and pin configuration".
  - Insert the SD card to the slot on the LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable and specify
    the port on Tera terminal corresponding to "mbed Serial Port".
  - Run the example. The message "SD read write data dma example test ok!"
    indicates a successful operation.

@par Run the example
  - Copy EPT generated files to the target project folder.
    - Copy ept_gpio_var.c and ept_eint_var.c to
      /project/mt2523_hdk/hal_examples/ept_configure_pins_by_ept/src/.
    - Copy ept_eint_drv.h, ept_gpio_drv.h and ept_keypad_drv.h to
      /project/mt2523_hdk/hal_examples/ept_configure_pins_by_ept/inc/.
    - Call the API bsp_ept_gpio_setting_init() to configure the EPT and
      on-board pins.
  - Build the example project with a command "./build.sh
    mt2523_hdk ept_configure_pins_by_ept bl" from the SDK root
    folder and download the binary file to LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable
    and specify the port on Tera terminal corresponding to "mbed Serial Port".
  - Run the example.The result is displayed in the log and
    "Pins have been initialized according to the configuration of EPT"
    indicates a successful operation.

@par Configuration
  - There are several variable names that can be assigned to different pins
    according to hardware and software design with help of EPT. All the GPIO
    and EINT variable names and the role assignment are provided in the table
    below. The software can use variable names to configure the corresponding
    pin without the need to know the pin number in the low level. This
    simplifies the work of porting the software to different platforms.
  - As for the GPIO variable names, it is necessary to assign the GPIO
    variable name to the correct pin according to the current pinmux setting
    or the corresponding peripheral may not work properly or the platform
    will not boot. For example, "HAL_KEYPAD_COL2_PIN", if one pin works in
    KCOL1 mode for keypad, the variable name of "HAL_KEYPAD_COL2_PIN" should
    be assigned to this pin, or something will be wrong with keypad module.
    The role assignment of all the GPIO variable names can be obtained from
    the table below.
  - As for the EINT variable name, it has the same effect as GPIO variable
    name other than that it is assigned to a different EINTx on the EINT page
    of EPT if the EINT has been assigned to a pin. Taking EINT variable name
    of "HAL_ACCDET_EINT" for example, if one pin is configured to work in
    EINT mode for ACCDET, variable name of "HAL_ACCDET_EINT" should be
    assigned to this pin, or something will be wrong with ACCDET module or
    the platform cannot boot.
  - The variable names and role assignment can be obtained from the table
    below, please pay extra attention on the comment field.

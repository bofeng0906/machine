@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example is a reference application to demonstrate how to configure
      an EINT with edge falling trigger mode.
    - This example does not require FreeRTOS.
  - Results
    - The result is printed in the log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - Select the pin function as EINT.
      |GPIOx    |PINx                             |
      |---------|---------------------------------|
      |  4      | CON6301 Right.5 (U305_EINT_CONN)|
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a type-A to micro-B USB cable
      to the PC from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data: 8bits, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with a command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    eint_edge_falling bl" from the SDK root folder and download the binary
    file to LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect CON6301 Right.5 to CON6102 Right.1.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable and specify
    the port on the terminal emulator software corresponding to "mbed Serial
    Port".
  - Run the example.
  - Disconnect CON6301 Right.5 from CON6102 Right.1.
  - The log will show "Received eint: 3!" to indicate a successful operation.

@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example is a reference application to demonstrate how use the SPI
      master APIs to send data with polling mode.
    - This example does not require FreeRTOS.
  - Results
    - The system will log "---spim_example end---" and the waveform from the
      SPI pins can be observed on an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - Connect J1007.2 to J1007.3
    - Connect J1009.2 to J1009.3
    - Connect J1010.2 to J1010.3
    - Connect J1011.2 to J1011.3
    - SPI master module pins mapping table are shown as below.
      | SPI Pin | GPIOx     |    PINx          |
      |-------  |---------  |----------------  |
      |  CS_N   | GPIO_25   | CON6301 Left.6   |
      |  SCK    | GPIO_26   | CON6301 Left.7   |

      |  MISO   | GPIO_28   | CON6301 Left.9   |
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a type-A to micro-B USB cable
      to the PC from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data: 8 bits, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.
    - Need an oscilloscope to capture the waveform.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with a command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    spi_master_polling" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file
    to LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect the related pins as shown in the "HDK switches and pin
    configuration" part.
  - Connect CON6301 Left.6, CON6301 Left.7, CON6301 Left.8 and CON6301 Left.9
    to oscilloscope and corresponding GND.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable and specify
    the port on Tera terminal corresponding to "mbed Serial Port".
  - Run the example. The system will log "---spim_example end---" and the
    waveform corresponding to "0x7E, 0x55" will be captured by the
    oscilloscope.

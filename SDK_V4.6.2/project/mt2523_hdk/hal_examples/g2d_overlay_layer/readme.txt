@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example is a reference to use the G2D APIs to render an image.
      This example does not require FreeRTOS.
  - Results
    - The rendered image is shown on the display module and the output logs
      are sent to the COM port.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK with MIPI 320*320 AMOLED display module.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
      - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
        HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
        in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with the command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    g2d_overlay_layer" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file
    to the LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a micro USB-cable.
  - Run the example. The log "G2D test done." indicates the destination image
    is rendered and the rendered image is shown on display module.

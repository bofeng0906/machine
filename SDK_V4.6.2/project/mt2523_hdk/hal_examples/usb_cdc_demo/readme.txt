@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example is a reference application to demonstrate the usage of USB
      HAL module APIs. The project runs without FreeRTOS.
  - Application features
    - The application demonstrates how to use USB connectivity feature of the
      LinkIt 2523 HDK to input and output data with USB CDC class.
  - Results
    - Echo the result from the host terminal software.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - Connect USB cable between PC Host and device
  - Environment configuration
    - USB host driver is the same as download tool.
    - A serial tool is required, such as hyper terminal, or TeraTerm.
    - COM port settings. Select the COM port corresponding to the connected
      MediaTek device, such as "MTK USB Port".

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with the command, "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    usb_cdc_demo" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file to
    the LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to PC with micro-USB cable before powering it on. Note,
    this example project doesn't support hot plugging,  plug in the cable
    before powering the device on.
  - Power on device, wait for execution of bootloader is finished, a new com
    port will generate.
  - When the host detects the USB device, then open a serial tool on the PC.
  - Input test data into USB COM port from terminal emulator software, such
    as TeraTerm.
  - Then received data will echo to the TeraTerm.

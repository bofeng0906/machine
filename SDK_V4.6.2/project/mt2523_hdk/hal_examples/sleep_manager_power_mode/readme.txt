@par Overview
  - Example project description
    - This project is a reference application to use the sleep manager APIs
      to force the system to enter sleep mode for power saving operations.
      - This application requires FreeRTOS.
      - Power monitor equipment is optional to verify the system status.
    - Results
      - The system will enter sleep mode in the specified order:
      - Deep-sleep
      - Sleep
      - Power off.
      - It remains in each state for five seconds.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK
  - Power monitor (optional)
  - Note:
    - For more details about using sleep manager APIs, please refer to LinkIt
      2523 API Reference Manual.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the application
  - Build the example project with the command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    sleep_manager_power_mode" from the SDK root folder and download the
    binary file to the LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a micro USB cable.
  - Connect J1014 SCL0 and J1014 SDA0 to the SCL (clock) and SDA (data) pins
    of the M24C01 EEPROM device, respectively. Connect VCC of EEPROM with
    CON6102 VIO18 and GND of EEPROM with J1018 GND on LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Run the application. The transaction result is displayed in the log,
    similar to the description below.
  - "Example : Enter Deep Sleep.", "[Start Enter Sleep]", the device will
    enter sleep mode then wake up after 5 seconds.
  - "Example : Enter Sleep. ","[Start Enter Sleep]", the device will enter
    sleep mode again and wake up after 5 seconds.
  - "Power off", the device will shut down, which indicates the application
    completed successfully.

@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This project is a reference application to apply the Audio APIs to
      output analog waveform using DAC module.
    - This project does not require FreeRTOS.
  - Results
    - A 1kHz tone will start to play through the earphone for 10 seconds and
      then stop.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - MediaTek LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - The required pin of DAC is TP1101.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with the command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    audio_play_1k_tone" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file
    to the LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a micro-USB cable.
  - Insert the earphone.
  - Run the example. A 1kHz tone will start to play through the earphone for
    10 seconds and then stop.

@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This project is a reference application to setup LCM and display images
      on the LCM.
  - Application features
    - The application automatically detects two different output interfaces
      MediaTek serial interface (240x240) and MIPI interface (320x320), then
      displays the images with different resolutions based on the interface
      selection.
  - Results
    - The LCM displays and switches between MediaTek logo and LinkIt logo
      every 5 seconds.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported HDK
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
      - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
        HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
        in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.

@par Run the application
  - Build the example project with the command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    display_drawing_image" from the SDK root folder and download the binary
    file to the LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Connect HDK to the PC with a micro-USB cable.
  - Run the application and observe the result. The LCM switches between
    MediaTek logo and LinkIt logo every 5 seconds.

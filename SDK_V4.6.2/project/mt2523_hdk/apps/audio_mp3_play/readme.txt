@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This project demonstrates how to setup MP3 play environment.
  - Application features
    - The project creates a task to demonstrate how to use the MP3 codec
      driver to play MP3 files.
  - Application process
    - Place three MP3 files in the SD card's temporary folder (temp/) and
      name them as "1.mp3", "2.mp3" and "3.mp3". Then boot the device.
  - Results
    - You can hear the MP3 sound. First, it'll play "1.mp3", then pause and
      resume again. After a while it will change file to "2.mp3", then pause
      and resume again. Finally, it'll play "3.mp3", pause and resume and
      then play to the end of the file.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported HDK
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Hardware environment
    - Requires an SD card to store the MP3 files.
    - Set J1001 and J1006 jumpers to pin 2 and 3.
  - Software environment
    - Modify GPIO configuration file (ept_gpio_drv.h) under "inc" folder to
      provide the SD card settings.
      \code
      #define GPIO_PORT30_MODE   MODE_5 // 5:MC0_CK
      #define GPIO_PORT31_MODE   MODE_5 // 5:MC0_CM0
      #define GPIO_PORT32_MODE   MODE_5 // 5:MC0_DA0
      #define GPIO_PORT33_MODE   MODE_5 // 5:MC0_DA1
      #define GPIO_PORT34_MODE   MODE_5 // 5:MC0_DA2
      #define GPIO_PORT35_MODE   MODE_5 // 5:MC0_DA3
      \endcode
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
      - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
        HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
        in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.

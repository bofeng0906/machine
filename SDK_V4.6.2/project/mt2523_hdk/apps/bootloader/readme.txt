@par Overview
  - This is not a example project. This project is a bootloader for LinkIt
    2523 HDK. The developer can refer this project to understand how to build
    a bootloader.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro USB cable to the PC
      from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.
  - Customization Option
    - \b MTK_FOTA_FS_ENABLE: Selects and enables the FOTA update via file
      (FOTA.bin) in SD card. Default FOTA update is via content in flash.
      Please note that this option needs to be enabled in the
      fota_download_manager project.

@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This is a reference application to demonstrate the usage of ATCI module
      APIs to register new AT commands.
  - Application process
    - Application input. Type in the test command "AT+TESTCMD" from a UART,
      such as Tera Terminal.
    - Results. The log will show the ATCI module processing and the AT
      command response "+TESTCMD:HELLO.OK" will show on the terminal.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.
    - The ATCI module transfers data through the UART 1, which is configured
      with GPIO30 as RXD, and GPIO31 as TXD.
    - ATCI COM port settings.baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
      parity: none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with the command for GCC compiler, "./build.sh
    mt2523_hdk atci_register_command" from the SDK root folder and download
    the binary file to LinkIt 2523 development board.
  - Connect board to PC with serial port cables, UART 1 for AT command.
  - Open serial tools for logging and AT command.
  - Run the example. Input AT command "AT+TESTCMD" thourgh the UART 1. The
    log will show the ATCI module processing and the AT command response
    "+TESTCMD:HELLO.OK" will show on command input tool through the UART 1.

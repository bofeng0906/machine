@par Overview
  - This demo project that can be customized to measure the current
    consumption of different application scenario and shows how to configure
    for each application scenario.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported HDK
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Enviroment configuration
    - Use power meter to verify the system current from measure VBAT.

@par Directory contents
  - Source and header files
    - \b src/low_power_demo/sleep_at_cmd.c:
      The source file of the sleep at command.
    - \b src/low_power_demo/bt_at_cmd.c:
      The source file of the BT at command.
    - \b src/low_power_demo/gnss_st_cmd.c:
      The source file of the GNSS at command.

@par Run the demo
  - Build the example project with the command, "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    iot_sdk_demo" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file to
    LinkIt 2523 development board.
  - Connect the board to PC with serial port cable.
  - Connect external power source, please refer to
    <sdk_root>/doc/board/mt2523_hdk/LinkIt_2523_HDK_Power_Measurement_Guide.pdf .
  - By default, the application uses USB-COM1 for AT command input.
  - Then enter "AT+EPORT=2,syslog,0\0d\0a", the result "OK" indicates the
    syslog automatically changed at runtime to use UART0.
  - Then enter "AT+EPORT=2,atci,1\0d\0a", the result "OK" indicates the AT
    command automatically changed at runtime to use UART1.
  - plug out USB cable.
  - This at command force the system to enter deep sleep mode for power
    saving operations
    - The steps are shown below:
      - Step1: input at command "AT+SM_DEMO=8,0\0d\0a" to close BT MTCMOS.
      - Step2: input at command "AT+SM_DEMO=8,3\0d\0a" disable battery
        manager.
      - Step3: input at command "AT+SM_DEMO=8,4\0d\0a" close VA28 LDO.
      - Step4: input at command "AT+SM_DEMO=6,2\0d\0a" to close all task.
      - Step5: input at command "AT+SM_DEMO=6,1\0d\0a" to unlock sleep
        handle.
      - Follow the above steps, you can verify the system low power status.
  - This at command force the system to enter sleep mode for GNSS power
    saving operations
    - The steps are shown below:
      - Step1: input at command "AT+SM_DEMO=8,0\0d\0a" to close BT MTCMOS.
      - Step2: input at command "AT+SM_DEMO=8,3\0d\0a" disable battery
        manager.
      - Step3: input at command "AT+SM_DEMO=8,4\0d\0a" close VA28 LDO.
      - Step4: input at command "AT+SM_DEMO=6,2\0d\0a" to close all task.
      - Step5: input at command "AT+EGPSC_DEMO=1\0d\0a" to open GNSS.
      - Step6: input at command "AT+SM_DEMO=6,1\0d\0a" to unlock sleep handle
      - Ensure to test it in an open area where the line of sight GNSS signal
        can be received.
      - Waiting about 15 minute for GNSS chip download the ephemeris, you can
        verify the
      - low power on GNSS tracking mode.

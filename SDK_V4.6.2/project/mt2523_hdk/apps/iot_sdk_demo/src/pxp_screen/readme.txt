@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This example project demonstrates the basic functions of Proximity
      profile (PXP).
  - Application features
    - The screen will display "Unconnected" when the HDK disconnects from the
      peer device.
    - The screen will display "Connected" when the HDK connects with the peer
      device.
    - The screen will display "Out of range" when the HDK alert level becomes
      value "1" or "2".

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK. For detailed configuration, please refer to readme.txt
      under mt2523_hdk/apps/iot_sdk_demo/.
  - Environment configuration
    - Need a serial tool (such as Tera terminal) for UART logging.
    - COM port settings: baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.
  - Peer test device
    - Download and install an app, such as "LightBlue", to connect to devices
      that support Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy, on iPhone 6S Plus or later
      version device.

@par Run the example
  - To run the application.
    - 1. Enter PXP's screen on LinkIt 2523 HDK - tap on "BLE PXP" on the main
      screen, it will display "Unconnected".
    - 2. Run the "LightBlue" app on the iPhone, and establish Bluetooth LE
      connection with the HDK. Find LinkIt 2523 HDK's BLE address or name,
      such as "MediaTek_PXP", tap to connect. The iPhone will enter the
      connection page, and will show all attributes (services,
      characteristics...), meanwhile the HDK will display a message
      "Connected".
    - 3. Send an alert and get a response on LinkIt 2523 HDK. On iPhone
      connection page, tap on "immediate alert" characteristic, then write
      value "1" or "2", to send an intermediate or high level alert to the
      HDK. In this example the LinkIt 2523 HDK will display a message "out of
      range" because the audio is not supported. Write value "0", to stop
      sending alerts to LinkIt 2523 HDK, then LinkIt 2523 HDK will be back to
      "connected" screen.
    - 4. Exit the app. The LinkIt 2523 HDK will disconnect and display a
      message "Unconnected".

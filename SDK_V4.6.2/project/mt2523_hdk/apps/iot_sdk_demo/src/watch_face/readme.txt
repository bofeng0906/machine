@par Overview
  - Application description
    - The application implements a watch screen that updates the time in low
      power mode. The time update happens every second by RTC notification.
      The LCM partially updates the time context part. Between the interval
      of the time update, the system enters the low power mode. The system
      wakes up by the RTC notification to enter the normal mode. After
      updating the current time, system enters the low power mode again.

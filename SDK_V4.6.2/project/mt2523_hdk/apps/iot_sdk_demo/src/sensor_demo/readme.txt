@par Overview
  - This project is a reference application on how to obtain heart rate (HR)
    and blood pressre (BP) data from MediaTek MT2511 biosensor daughterboard.
    The HR and BP data are displayed on the UI.
  - Enable the sensor
    - Call the function #hal_pinmux_set_function() or use the EPT tool to set
      the GPIO pinmux to configure the I2C digital interface and external
      interrupt pinmux settings. Please refer to bsp_sensor_peripheral_init()
      in [sdk_root]/driver/board/mt25x3_hdk/mems_init/mems_init.c.
    - Call the fucntion #sensor_subscribe_sensor() to get the HR and BP data.
    - Sensor subsystem task (sensor_mgr_task() in
      [sdk_root]/middleware/MTK/sensor_subsys/src/sensor_manager.c) feeds
      accelerometer and biosensor data into fusion algorithm to get heart
      rate and blood pressure measurements.
  - Results
    - UI displays the HR and BP data. Please note that HR data update is
      paused while BP is being measured.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported HDK
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
    - MediaTek MT2511 biosensor daughterboard (model number: MTK0067).
    - Optical module sub-board (model number: WS3524).
    - An electrocardiography (EKG) cable.
  - Environment configuration
    - Connect MediaTek MT2511 biosensor daughterboard to the LinkIt 2523 HDK
      using the Sensor interface on the development board.
    - Connect an EKG cable to the daughterboard.
    - Connect an optical module sub-board to the daughterboard. The optical
      module sub-board uses the light-based technology to sense the rate of
      blood flow controlled by the heart's pumping action.
  - Customization Option
    - \b SENSOR_DEMO determines whether the sensor features such as heart
      rate monitor and blood pressure monitor are contained in this project.
    - \b MTK_SENSOR_BIO_USE_MT2511 selects and enables the driver for
      MediaTek MT2511 biosensor. Please make sure MediaTek MT2511 biosensor
      daughterboard is connected to the LinkIt 2523 HDK.
    - \b FUSION_HEART_RATE_MONITOR_USE enables MediaTek heart rate monitor
      fusion algorithm library under
      middleware/MTK/sensor_subsys/lib/fusion_algo folder.
    - \b FUSION_HEART_RATE_VARIABILITY_USE enables MediaTek heart rate
      variability monitor fusion algorithm library under
      middleware/MTK/sensor_subsys/lib/fusion_algo folder. Please note that
      this definition and FUSION_BLOOD_PRESSURE_USE should be used
      exclusively.
    - \b FUSION_BLOOD_PRESSURE_USE enables MediaTek blood pressure monitor
      fusion algorithm library under
      middleware/MTK/sensor_subsys/lib/fusion_algo folder. Please note that
      this definition and FUSION_HEART_RATE_VARIABILITY_USE should be used
      exclusively.
    - \b FUSION_PEDOMETER_USE is for pedometer and not used in this project.
    - \b FUSION_SLEEP_TRACKER_USE is for sleep tracker and not used in this
      project.

@par Run the application
  - Press "Sensor Subsystem" on the main display.
  - The EKG cable has three leads with electrode patch. Stick the green and
    black electrode patches to the left arm, stick the red electrode patch to
    the right arm.
  - Place your hand on the optical module sub-board.
  - Observe the HR and BP data change on the display.
    - Sensor subsystem display will show the HR data changes.
    - Press "BP" on the sensor subsystem display.
      - Sensor subsystem display will show the BP data.
      - Wait a few seconds for the BP data measurement. Please note that HR
        data update is paused.
      - Sensor subsystem display will show the BP measurements.

/**
 * The Model class defines the data model in the model-view-presenter paradigm.
 * The Model is a singular object used across all presenters. The currently active
 * presenter will have a pointer to the Model through deriving from ModelListener.
 *
 * The Model will typically contain UI state information that must be kept alive
 * through screen transitions. It also usually provides the interface to the rest
 * of the system (the backend). As such, the Model can receive events and data from
 * the backend and inform the current presenter of such events through the modelListener
 * pointer, which is automatically configured to point to the current presenter.
 * Conversely, the current presenter can trigger events in the backend through the Model.

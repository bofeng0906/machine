 * @class PainterColoredBitmap PainterColoredBitmap.hpp gui/graph_screen/PainterColoredBitmap.hpp
 *
 * @brief A Painter that will paint using a bitmap with a given color.
 *
 *        PainterColoredBitmap will take the color for a given point from a bitmap. The pixel
 *        from the bitmap is 'multiplied' with the given color. This means that if the given
 *        color is red (255,0,0), the blue and green parts of the image will be masked out.
 *        Interesting effects can be obtained if the given image contains colors from the
 *        entire spectrum, but usually the bitmap will be a gray scale bitmap and in this case
 *        the painter can be used to get various shades of the selected color.
 *

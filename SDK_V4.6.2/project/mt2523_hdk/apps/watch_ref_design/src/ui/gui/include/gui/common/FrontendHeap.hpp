 * This class provides the memory that shall be used for memory allocations
 * in the frontend. A single instance of the FrontendHeap is allocated once (in heap
 * memory), and all other frontend objects such as views, presenters and data model are
 * allocated within the scope of this FrontendHeap. As such, the RAM usage of the entire
 * user interface is sizeof(FrontendHeap).
 *
 * @note The FrontendHeap reserves memory for the most memory-consuming presenter and
 * view only. The largest of these classes are determined at compile-time using template
 * magic. As such, it is important to add all presenters, views and transitions to the
 * type lists in this class.

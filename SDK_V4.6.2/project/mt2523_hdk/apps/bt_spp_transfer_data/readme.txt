@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This application describes how to use BT SPP API to create a SPP server
      and a SPP client.
    - Results
      - The transaction output is collected in a log and showed in the SP.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro USB cable to the PC
      from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.
  - Remote device configuration
    - Install any Bluetooth SPP application that supports both the SPP server
      and the SPP client on the Smartphone from App Store.
    - PC/environment configuration
    - Use SecureCRT or other hyperterminal to output system log.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the application with the command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    bt_spp_transfer_data".
  - Connect board to PC with serial port cable.
  - Set the correct Smartphone Bluetooth address in the BT SPP client example
    file, then build the example project and download the binary file to the
    LinkIt 2523 development board.
  - Launch SPP application and enable SPP server on the Smartphone.
  - Power on the LinkIt 2523 development board, the SPP client example will
    automatically connect to the Smartphone.
  - The SPP client example will send string of "Hello SPP Server!" to the
    Smartphone.
  - Disconnects the SPP connection from the Smartphone.
  - Initiate the connection to SPP server example from the Smartphone.
  - The SPP server example will send string of "Hello SPP Client!" to the
    Smartphone.
  - Disconnect the SPP connection from the Smartphone.

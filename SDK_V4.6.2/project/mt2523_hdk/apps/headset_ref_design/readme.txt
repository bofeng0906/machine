@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This application demonstrates headset features based on MediaTek MT2523
      SOC for RTOS development platform. The architecture diagram is shown 
      below.
      @image html headset_ref_design_architecture.png
    - Application features
      - Sink. Enables to connect with a remote device, handle calls and play music
        from the remote device.
      - Battery Service (BAS). Provides the battery status of MT2523 to a remote
        device.
      - Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS). Provides a simple and convenient
        way to access the notifications generated on the iOS devices.
      - Bluetooth Notification. Receives and displays notifications from Android
        devices.
      - Audio Player. Plays local MP3 music.
      - Firmware update Over The Air (FOTA). Uses Bluetooth notification service to 
        receive FOTA packages and trigger an update on the target board.
      - Find Me Profile (FMP). Allows users to find the misplaced device using
        Bluetooth LE.
      - Low Power demo. Provides the method to measure the current consumption
        of different scenario by AT command. User should strictly follow the 
        measuring steps provided in the readme file of low power 
        sub-folder(src\low_power_demo). 
      - The application features are independent, if not otherwise mentioned.
        
@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a type-A to micro-B USB cable
      to the PC from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.
    - By default, the application uses UART0 for logging.
    - By default, the application uses MK20 for AT command input, corresponds 
       to "mbed Serial Port" under Device Manager of the PC.
    - Please contact MediaTek customer support team to find more information
      regarding the pin configuration, hardware peripheral setup, debugger setup and
      more.
  - Customization options and usage
    - No compile option is available to disable an application feature.
    - To disable a feature, delete the feature initialization function in
       the main.c.

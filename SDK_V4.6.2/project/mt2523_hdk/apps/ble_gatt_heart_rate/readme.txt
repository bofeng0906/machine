@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This project is a reference application to use the GATTC and GATTS APIs
      to communicate with a Bluetooth LE device.
  - Results
    - The transaction output is collected in a log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 2523
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 2523 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 2523 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the application with the command "./build.sh mt2523_hdk
    ble_gatt_heart_rate". from the SDK root folder and download the binary
    file to the LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - Power on LinkIt 2523 HDK.
  - As a HeartRate Server, Input "a", then search the device "MTKHB" from
    this in Client, then connect. after connected, the heartrate value will
    show in Client.
  - As a HeartRate Client, Input "s", it will start scan and result is show
    in log.
    - The log such as :"heart_rate_scan_cb: -- start: type = 1" ,
      "heart_rate_scan_cb: -- start:addr[0] = 0x5d, addr[1] = 0xfc, addr[2] =
      0x2b, addr[3] = 0x37, addr[4] = 0x9f, addr[5] = 0xee" indicates remote
      device's type and address.
    - Then do connect, input "c type address", the value of type is 0 or 1,
      address is target remote address.
    - After connected, the log "heart_rate_update_notify_cb:start--
      heart_value = ..." will show.
    - If you want to disconnect the link, please input "d".it will disconnect
      this connection.

@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example describes how to setup FreeRTOS multitasking environment.
      The project creates four tasks. Each task sleeps for a certain amount
      of time measured in OS ticks and prints the logs when it awakes.
  - Process / procedure of the example project
    - Declare and initialize four tasks and schedule at different intervals.
  - Results
    - Log will show when a task wakes up.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported HDK
    - MediaTek LinkIt 7697 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - N/A.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a type-A to micro-B USB cable
      to the PC from MK20 USB connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7697
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7697 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7697 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data: 8 bits, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the demo
  - Build the example project with a command "./build.sh linkit7697_hdk
    freertos_create_thread" from the SDK root folder and download the binary
    file to LinkIt 7697 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable and specify
    the port on Tera terminal corresponding to "mbed Serial Port".
  - Run the example. The log will show "hello world x", where x is the task
    ID with the range from 0 to 3.

@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example is a reference application to use SPI master APIs to send
      data in polling mode.
    - This example does not require FreeRTOS.
  - Results
    - The system will log "---spim_example end---" and the waveform from the
      SPI pins can be observed on an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7697 HDK.
  - HDK swithes, pin configurations
    - SPI master module pins mapping table are shown as below.
      | SPI Pin |   GPIOx    |    PINx    |
      | ------- | ---------  | ---------- |
      |  CS_N   |  GPIO_32   |    P10     |
      |  SCK    |  GPIO_31   |    P13     |
      |  MOSI   |  GPIO_29   |    P11     |
      |  MISO   |  GPIO_30   |    P12     |
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a type-A to micro-B USB cable
      to the PC from USB (CON5) connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7697
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7697 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      CON5 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7697 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.
    - Need an oscilloscope to capture the waveform.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with a command "./build.sh linkit7697_hdk
    spi_master_polling" under the SDK root folder and download the binary
    file to LinkIt 7697 HDK.
  - Connect P10, P11, P12, P13 to oscilloscope and the corresponding
    GND.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable and specify
    the port on Tera terminal corresponding to "mbed Serial Port".
  - Run the example. The system will log "---spim_example end---" and the
    waveform corresponding to "0x7E, 0x55" can be captured by the
    oscilloscope.

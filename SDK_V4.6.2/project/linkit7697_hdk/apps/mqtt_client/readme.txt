@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This application is a simple demonstration program which shows how to
      use the MQTT APIs.
  - Features of the example project
    - This example demonstrates incluide 2 parts, connection to non-SSL
      server, and connection to SSL server. Both example include subscribe
      and publish messages.
    - This application explain user to how to:
    - 1. Connect to a non-SSL MQTT server
    - 2. Subscribe one topic to MQTT server
    - 3. Publish three messages(QOS0, QOS1, QOS2)to MQTT server and receive
      messages from MQTT server in sequence
    - 4. Unsubscribe to MQTT server
    - 5. Disconnect to MQTT server
    - 6. Connect to a SSL server, repear 2 to 5
  - Results
    - The transaction output is collected in a log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7697 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro USB cable to the PC
      from USB (CON5) connector on the HDK.
      - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7697
        HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7697 HDK User Guide"
        in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7697 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.
      - Configure a Wi-Fi router with the SSID as SQA_TEST_AP, password as
        77777777, and authentication mode as WPA_PSK_WPA2_PSK. The Wi-Fi
        router should have the internet connection.
      - You can change the default settings in main.c to adapt the device to
        your Wi-Fi Accesss Point by specifying SSID and password.

@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example is a reference application to erase, read and write data
      from/to the flash.
    - This example does not require FreeRTOS.
  - Results
    - The result is in the system log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - N/A.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a type-A to micro-B USB cable
      to the PC from USB (CON5) connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7687
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7687 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      CON5 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7687 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with a command "./build.sh mt7687_hdk
    flash_read_write_data" from the SDK root folder and download the binary
    file to the LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable and specify
    the port on the serial terminal corresponding to "mbed Serial Port".
  - Run the example. The log "Flash example is successful!" indicates a
    successful operation.

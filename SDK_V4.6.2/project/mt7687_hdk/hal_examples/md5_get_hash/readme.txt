@par Overview
  - Example project description
    - This project is a reference application to use the MD5 APIs for hash
      operations, including these functionalities.
      - Initialization: Initialize the context.
      - Append: Keep feeding the data into the module.
      - End: Get the final MD5 value.
      - The append API can be called multiple times, for the scenario that
        the input data does not exist at the beginning, such as streaming
        data.
    - Results
      - The calculation output is collected in a log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - This example project will output logs via HDK USB (CON5) to PC. Please
      connect a micro USB cable from a PC to CON5 port, install the mbed
      serial driver, and launch Tera terminal in PC for logging as below.
      - Require a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of PC and
        micro-B USB of the LinkIt 7687 HDK development board. For more
        information about type-A plug and micro-B plug, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Install the mbed serial driver as instructed at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refere to the installing the LinkIt 7687 HDK
        drivers on Microsoft Windows section of the LinkIt 7687 HDK user
        guides under [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - A serial tool for UART logging is required, such as Tera terminal.
        Please refer to the installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows
        section of get startedguide under [sdk_root]/doc folder for more
        information.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with the command, "./build.sh mt7687_hdk
    md5_get_hash" from the SDK root folder and download the bin file to
    LinkIt 7687 development board.
  - Connect your board to the PC with a micro USB cable.
  - Run the example. The result of its MD5 calculation is displayed in the
    log.

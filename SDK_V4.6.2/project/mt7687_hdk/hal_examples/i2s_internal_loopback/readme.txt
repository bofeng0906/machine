@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example is a reference application to demonstrate the usage of I2S
      module APIs. This example project does not require FreeRTOS.
    - Features of the example project
    - This project is a reference application to use the I2S APIs to apply an
      internal loopback. The data sent from the I2S TX link will be looped
      back to the I2S RX link.
  - Results
    - The input and output of transmitted data are described below.
    - Input to the example.
      - Data in the audio_Tone2k_16kSR array is shown below: 0xffff, 0xcd1a,
        0xb805, 0xcd1b, 0x0000, 0x32e6, 0x47fb, 0x32e5, 0x0000, 0xcd1a,
        0xb805, 0xcd1b, 0x0000, 0x32e5, 0x47fb, 0x32e5, 0x0000, 0xcd1b,
        0xb805, 0xcd1b, 0x0000, 0x32e5, 0x47fb, 0x32e5, 0x0000, 0xcd1b,
        0xb806, 0xcd1a, 0xffff, 0x32e5, 0x47f9, 0x32e6
    - Output from the example.
      - Log will show the data received by I2S RX link: 0xffff, 0xcd1a,
        0xb805, 0xcd1b, 0x0000, 0x32e6, 0x47fb, 0x32e5, 0x0000, 0xcd1a,
        0xb805, 0xcd1b, 0x0000, 0x32e5, 0x47fb, 0x32e5, 0x0000, 0xcd1b,
        0xb805, 0xcd1b, 0x0000, 0x32e5, 0x47fb, 0x32e5, 0x0000, 0xcd1b,
        0xb806, 0xcd1a, 0xffff, 0x32e5, 0x47f9, 0x32e6

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - N/A
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from USB (CON5) connector on the HDK.
      - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7687
        HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7687 HDK User Guide"
        in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7687 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data: 8 bits, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.

@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example is a reference application to use GPIO APIs to pull up and
      pull down the pin J35.3 and how to get input data after pull state is
      changed.
    - This example does not require FreeRTOS.
  - Results
    - The log will show whether the pull state has changed successfully.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7687 HDK
  - HDK switches and pin configurations
      - I2C0 pin mapping is listed below.
        |GPIOx    |PINx       |
        |---------|-----------|
        |  33     |J35.3      |
    - Make sure J35.3 is disconnected.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a type-A to micro-B USB cable
      to the PC from USB (CON5) connector on the HDK.
    - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
      https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
      more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7687
      HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7687 HDK User Guide"
      in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
      CON5 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7687 HDK. For more information
      about the connector cable, please refer to
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
    - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
      for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
      refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on the
      "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
    - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data: 8 bits, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none and flow control: off.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with a command "./build.sh mt7687_hdk
    gpio_configure_pull_state" from the SDK root folder and download the
    binary file to LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Make sure J35.3 is disconnected.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a type-A to micro-B USB cable and open the
    port on Tera terminal corresponding to "mbed Serial Port".
  - Run the example. The message "GPIO pull state configuration is
    successful" indicates a successful operation.

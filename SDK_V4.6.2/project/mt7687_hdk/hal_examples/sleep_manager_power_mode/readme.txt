@par Overview
  - Example description
    - This example is a reference application to use the sleep manager APIs
      to force system to enter sleep mode for power saving operation.
    - This application requires FreeRTOS.
    - Power monitor equipment is optional to verify the system status.
  - Results
    - The system enters into the WFI mode for 3 seconds and then into Legacy
      sleep mode for another 3 seconds.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Power monitor (optional)
  - Note:
    - Please refer to LinkIt 7687 HDK Power Consumption Measurement Guide
      about how to connect power monitor with 7687 HDK board.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from USB (CON5) connector on the HDK.
      - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7687
        HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7687 HDK User Guide"
        in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7687 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, databits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.
  - Customization Option
    - \b MTK_WIFI_REPEATER_ENABLE:
      Wi-Fi repeater mode compile option, due to AP part need a exactly IP
      address when local STA communcation with 7687 in repeater mode. This is
      enabled at default. If it is defined disabled, the repeat mode function
      will not be supported.

@par Run the example
  - Build the example project with the command "./build.sh mt7687_hdk
    sleep_manager_power_mode" from the SDK root folder and download the
    binary file to the LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Connect HDK to the PC with a micro-USB cable.
  - Connect the power monitor to the LinkIt 7687 HDK (optional).
  - Run the example. The system status is displayed in the log and switches
    between sleep modes until it's powered off.

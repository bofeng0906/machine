@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This project demonstrates connectivity features of the Linkit 7687 HDK.
    - The example application is a reference design for home security and OTA
      applications. The following features used in this reference design are
      applicable to home security applications:
      - SSL and UDP example (src/3tls_6udp.c)
      - Dual image FOTA by HTTP/HTTPS
        - Operation command: fota dual http://192.168.1.3/ or fota dual
          https://192.168.1.3/
        - There are 5 files to place on HTTP or HTTPS server:
          - hash_check
          - image_cm4_A
          - image_cm4_B

@par Run the examples
  - Connect the board to PC with a serial port cable.
  - Build the example project and download the binary file to the LinkIt 7687
    HDK.
  - Reboot the HDK, the console will show "FreeRTOS Running" message to
    indicate the HDK is booting up.
  - Use the '?' command to query the available command line options. Note
    that the command line options are still under development and subject to
    change without notice.
  - Below are two examples to demonstrate the Wi-Fi station and Wi-Fi access
    point modes of the Linkit 7687 HDK.
  - Example 1. Wi-Fi station mode.
    - Find your Wi-Fi access point settings: Before connecting to a Wi-Fi
      access point, the following information needs to be collected:
      -# The SSID of your Wi-Fi access point.
      -# The authentication mode of your Wi-Fi access point. In general, the
         authentication mode is WPA PSK or WPA2 PSK. To change the mode,
         please refer to Table 1 for the list of supported authentication
         modes.
      -# The password of your Wi-Fi access point.
      -# The encryption mode of your Wi-Fi access point. In general, AES or
         TKIP is used. To change the mode, please refer to Table 2 for the
         list of supported encryption modes.
    - Once the information is collected, use the following commands to
      configure the LinkIt 7687 HDK. The example code in main.c assumes
      either WPA PSK or WPA2 PSK is used for authentication, TKIP or AES for
      encryption, 'myhome' (length 6) for the SSID, and the password of the
      WPA or WPA2 is '12345678' (length 8).
      \code
      config write STA AuthMode 9
      config write STA EncrypType 8
      config write STA Ssid myhome
      config write STA SsidLen 6
      config write STA WpaPsk 12345678
      config write STA WpaPskLen 8
      config write common OpMode 1
      \endcode
    - Press the reset button on the LinkIt 7687 HDK to restart the system.
    - Boot up with the new configuration. If everything is correct, similar
      messages will be shown in the console to notify your HDK has received
      an IP address.
      \code
      DHCP got IP:10.10.10.101
      \endcode
    - PING from the LinkIt 7687 HDK (SDK v3.1.0). If the IP address is
      fetched and the network is operating, the LinkIt 7687 can ping other
      devices on the network with the following command in the console.
      \code
      ping 10.10.10.254 3 64
      The ping stops after sending three packets to 10.10.10.254.
      The ping usage is: ping <ip address> <times> <ping packet length>
      \endcode
    - Wi-Fi configuration options for AuthMode and EncrypType.

      Table 2. Supported EncrypType(s)
      \endcode
  - Example 2. Wi-Fi access point mode.
    - Provide the Wi-Fi access point settings:
      - SSID
      - Authentication Mode
      - Encryption Type
      - Password
    - Once the information is collected, use the following commands to
      configure the LinkIt 7687 HDK. This example assumes WPA2 PSK is used
      for authentication, AES for encryption, 'iot_ap' (length 6) for the
      SSID, and the password of the WPA2 is '87654321' (length 8).
      \code
      config write AP Ssid iot_ap
      config write AP SsidLen 6
      config write AP AuthMode 7
      config write AP EncrypType 6
      config write AP WpaPsk 87654321
      config write AP WpaPskLen 8
      config write common OpMode 2
      \endcode
    - Press the reset button on the LinkIt 7687 HDK to restart the system.
    - Use a handheld device or a laptop computer to connect to the access
      point 'iot_ap'. In the console, the IP address assigned to the handheld
      device or laptop is:
      \code
      [DHCPD:DBG]lease_ip:10.10.10.2
      \endcode

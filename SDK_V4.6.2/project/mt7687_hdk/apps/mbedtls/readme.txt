@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This application consists of some demonstrations for the features
      mbedtls provides, such as AES demonstration, MD5 demonstration, SSL
      client demonstration, and so on. For more detail of each demonstration,
      please refer to the descriptions below.
  - Features of the application
    - AES: AES encryption & decryption demonstration program.
    - MD5: md5 demonstration program.
    - MPI: MPI demonstration program.
    - RSA encrypt & decrypt: RSA encryption & decryption demonstration
      program.
    - PK encrypt & decrypt: Public key-based encryption & decryption program.
    - Selftest: Self-test demonstration program.
    - SSL client: SSL client demonstration program.
  - Results
    - The output is collected in a log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from USB (CON5) connector on the HDK.
      - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7687
        HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7687 HDK User Guide"
        in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7687 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.

@par Run the application
  - Build the application with the command "./build.sh mt7687_hdk mbedtls"
    from the SDK root folder and download the binary file to the LinkIt 7687
    evelopment board.
  - Connect your board to the PC with a micro-USB cable.
  - Set up a WiFi router which connects to the internet.
    - Router settings: name: SQA_TEST_AP, password: 77777777, auth mode:
      WPA_PSK_WPA2_PSK.
    - You can also change the default settings in main.c to adapt the device
      to your Wi-Fi Access Point by specifying authentication mode,
      encryption mode, SSID, and password.
  - Run the application. The transaction result is displayed in the log.
    "example project test success" printed in the log indicates a success.

 * - An example on how to use the prompt_control APIs.
 *  - 1.  Voice Prompt application select a prompt sound.
 *        Use #prompt_control_play_tone() to play the prompt sound.
 *  - 2.  Voice Prompt application may halt the playback by using #prompt_control_stop_tone().
 *  - 3.  Voice Prompt application may adjust volume weighting by using #voice_prompt_mix_set_mixer_gain.
 *    - Sample code:
 *     @code

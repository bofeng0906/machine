 * The audio mixer is used to mix main track (for example, A2DP playback or Audio Player) and side track (for example, prompt sound).
 *
 * @section audio_mixer_api_usage How to use this module
 *
 * - An example on how to use the audio mixer APIs. \n
 *  - 1.  Audio Player plays a mp3 file. In MP3 codec, use #audio_mixer_get_track_id to get track ID and \n
 *        use #audio_mixer_start_track to play the audio track.
 *  - 2.  Voice Prompt application open a prompt sound. \n
 *        Voice Prompt application use the member function "set_track_role" of nedia handle to indicate the side track. \n
 *        media_handle->set_track_role().
 *        Then Voice Prompt calls  #audio_mixer_get_track_id to get track ID and #audio_mixer_start_track to plays the prompt sound.
 *  - 3.  Audio mixer will mix the aound of Audio Player and Voice Prompt.
 *  - 4.  Voice Prompt application may adjust volume weighting by using #audio_mixer_set_volume.
 *  - 5.  When playback is paused or stoped, codec will call #audio_mixer_stop_track to stop the playback, and \n
 *        call #audio_mixer_free_track_id to free the track ID.
 *    - Sample code:
 *     @code

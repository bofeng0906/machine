 * This section introduces the FOTA interface APIs including terms and acronyms, supported features, software architecture, details on how to use this interface, FOTA function groups, enums, structures and functions.
 * This interface writes into a pre-defined register flag. The bootloader enters the update process based on the value written in the flag. The return error code indicates if the flag is written successfully or not. 
 * After the update is complete, the UA automatically resets the register flag.
 * Note, it is recommended to call the reboot API after calling the FOTA interface, because fota_trigger_update() does not contain reboot functionality.
 * There is no dedicated FOTA read or write SDK API, it is suggested to use HAL flash SDK API to write data to specified address of flash.
 * Regarding to the FOTA update flow & usage, please refer to the Firmware Update Developers Guide located under [sdk_root]/doc folder.

 * |\b TFTP                       | Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple, lockstep, File Transfer Protocol which allows a client to get from or put a file onto a remote host. One of its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting from a local area network. For an introduction to TFTP, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol"> TFTP in Wikipedia.</a>|

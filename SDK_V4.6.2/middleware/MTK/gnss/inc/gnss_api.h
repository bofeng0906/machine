 *
 * @section GNSS_Architechture_Chapter Software architecture of GNSS.
 * The GNSS chip is a System-in-Package (SiP) in LinkIt 2523 board by SAC that connects with the host using UART.
 *
 * @section GNSS_Usage_Chapter How to use GNSS interface.
 * - step 1: Call #gnss_init() to initialize the GNSS content and register a callback function.
 * - step 2: Call #gnss_power_on() to power on the GNSS chip.
 * - step 3: Call #gnss_send_command() to configure GNSS chip settings, such as aiding time.
 * - step 4: Call #gnss_read_sentence() to read the incoming NMEA data.
 * - step 5: Call #gnss_power_off() to power off the GNSS chip.
 * - Sample code:
 * @code
 * int32_t rx_data_ready = 0;
 * int32_t tx_data_ready = 1;
 * void my_callback_func(gnss_callback_type_t type, void *param)
 * {
 *     if (type == GNSS_NOTIFICATION_TYPE_READ) {
 *         // The incoming NMEA sentence is available to read.

 *         rx_data_ready = 1;
 *     }

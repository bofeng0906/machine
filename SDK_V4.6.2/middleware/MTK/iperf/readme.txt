Brief:          This module is the implementation of iperf 2.x protocol.
Usage:          GCC: Include the module with "include $(SOURCE_DIR)/middleware/mtk/iperf/module.mk" in your GCC project Makefile and set MTK_IPERF_ENABLE to "y".
                KEIL:Drag the middleware/MTK/iperf folder to your project and define the MTK_IPERF_ENABLE macro. Add middleware/MTK/iperf/inc to include paths.
                IAR: Drag the middleware/MTK/iperf folder to your project and define the MTK_IPERF_ENABLE macro. Add middleware/MTK/iperf/inc to include paths.
Dependency:     MTK_MINICLI_ENABLE must be defined in feature.mk and include lwip module in your project.

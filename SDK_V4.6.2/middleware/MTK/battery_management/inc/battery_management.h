 * @section Battery_management_Usage_Chapter How to use the battery management interface
 *
 * - Step 1: Call #battery_management_init() to initialize the battery management.
 *           Initialize the battery management after the hardware initialization, such as HAL driver and platform initialization, before creating any tasks.
 * - Step 2: Call #battery_management_register_callback() to register a callback function to receive the battery management event.
 * - Step 3: Call #battery_management_get_battery_property() to get the battery information.
 * - Step 4: Call #battery_management_deinit() to deinitialize the battery management before the system powers off.

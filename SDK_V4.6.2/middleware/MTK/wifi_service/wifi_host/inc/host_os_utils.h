 * The following functions are wrapper for standard ANSI C or POSIX functions.
 * By default, they are just defined to use the standard function name and no
 * os_*.c implementation is needed for them. This avoids extra function calls
 * by allowing the C pre-processor take care of the function name mapping.
 *
 * If the target system uses a C library that does not provide these functions,
 * build_config.h can be used to define the wrappers to use a different
 * function name. This can be done on function-by-function basis since the
 * defines here are only used if build_config.h does not define the os_* name.
 * If needed, os_*.c file can be used to implement the functions that are not
 * included in the C library on the target system. Alternatively,
 * OS_NO_C_LIB_DEFINES can be defined to skip all defines here in which case
 * these functions need to be implemented in os_*.c file for the target system.

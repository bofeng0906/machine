/**@addtogroup WIFI
* @{
* This section introduces the Wi-Fi driver APIs including terms and acronyms, supported features,
* software architecture, details on how to use this driver, Wi-Fi function groups, enumerations,
* structures and functions. The Wi-Fi APIs are divided into three categories:
* Profile, Configuration and Connection. And there are four types of operation modes supported in Wi-Fi module:
* #WIFI_MODE_STA_ONLY, #WIFI_MODE_AP_ONLY, #WIFI_MODE_REPEATER and #WIFI_MODE_MONITOR.
*
* Profile APIs get or set the profile in the Flash memory. The profile settings can be read by
* Wi-Fi profile get APIs. The profile settings can be used to initialize the Wi-Fi
* driver configuration at system boot up. There are many profile sections in the Flash memory, such as:
* STA, AP, common. Use the same profile section for #WIFI_PORT_STA/#WIFI_PORT_APCLI.
*
* Configuration APIs get and set the Wi-Fi driver configuration. In most cases they take effect
* immediately, but there are some configuration APIs that only take
* effect by calling the #wifi_host_config_reload_setting() API, such as: \n
* #wifi_host_config_set_security_mode() \n
* #wifi_host_config_set_ssid() \n
*
* The Configuration APIs include wifi_host_config_xxx APIs. They use in-band mechanism (in-band is a mechanism used for Wi-Fi driver and Wi-Fi firmware communication),
* thus these APIs must be called after OS task scheduler is started to make sure an in-band task is running.
*
* The Connection APIs include wifi_host_connection_xxx APIs. They manage the link status, such as disconnect AP, disconnect the station, get the link status, get the station list, start or stop the scan.
* Register an event handler for scan, connect or disconnect event. The Connection APIs use an in-band mechanism, thus these APIs must be called after the OS Task
* scheduler is started, to make sure an in-band task is running.
*

 * |Terms                         |Details                                                                  |

 * |\b BAS                        | Battery Service. This service exposes the battery state and battery level to the peer device. |
 *
 * @section ble_bas_api_usage How to use this module
 * - Step 1. Add BAS service to the application's GATT service database. And then return the bt_gatts_service_t pointer to GATTS stack by implementing the user-defined callback @ref bt_get_gatt_server(). 
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *               // The GATTS collects all services.
 *               const bt_gatts_service_t * ble_gatt_server[] = {
 *                   &ble_gap_service,  // handle range: 0x0001 to 0x0009.
 *                   &ble_gatt_service, // handle range: 0x0011 to 0x0015.
 *                   &ble_bas_service,  // handle range: 0x0031 to 0x0034.
 *                   NULL
 *                };
 *                const bt_gatts_service_t** bt_get_gatt_server()
 *                { 
 *                    return ble_gatt_server;
 *                }

 *     @endcode
 * - Step 2. Implement the user-defined callback @ref ble_bas_read_callback() to listen to the read event of Battery Level Characteristic and Client Configuration Characteristic Descriptor from the peer device.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                uint8_t ble_bas_read_callback(ble_bas_event_t event, uint16_t conn_handle)
 *                {
 *                    if (conn_handle) {
 *                        switch (event) {
 *                            case BLE_BAS_EVENT_BATTRY_LEVEL_READ:
 *                                uint8_t battery_level = 100;
 *                                return battery_level;
 *                            case BLE_BAS_EVENT_CCCD_READ:
 *                                uint8_t notify_enabled = 1;
 *                                return notify_enabled;
 *                            default :
 *                                break;
 *                        }
 *                    }
 *                    return 0;
 *                }
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 3. Implement the user-defined callback @ref ble_bas_write_callback() to listen to the write event of Client Configuration Characteristic Descriptor from the peer device.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                void ble_bas_write_callback(ble_bas_event_t event, bt_handle_t conn_handle, void *data)
 *                {
 *                    uint16_t cccd_value = 0;
 *                    cccd_value = *(uint16_t *)data;
 *                    if ((conn_handle) && (BLE_BAS_EVENT_CCCD_WRITE == event)) {
 *                        //Save the data;
 *                    }
 *                }
 *     @endcode
 * - Step 4. Notify the Battery State of the device to the peer device.
 *  - Sample code:
 *     @code 
 *                uint8_t battery_level = get_current_battery_api();
 *                ble_bas_notify_battery_level(conn_handle, battery_level);
 *     @endcode

 *
 * @section ble_ias_api_usage How to use this module
 * - Step 1. Add IAS service to the application's GATT service database. And then return the bt_gatts_service_t pointer to GATTS stack by implementing the user-defined callback @ref bt_get_gatt_server(). 
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *               // The GATTS collects all services.
 *               const bt_gatts_service_t * ble_gatt_server[] = {
 *                   &ble_gap_service,  // handle range: 0x0001 to 0x0009.
 *                   &ble_gatt_service, // handle range: 0x0011 to 0x0015.
 *                   &ble_ias_service,  // handle range: 0x0040 to 0x0042.
 *                   NULL
 *                };
 *                const bt_gatts_service_t** bt_get_gatt_server()
 *                { 
 *                    return ble_gatt_server;
 *                }

 *     @endcode
 * - Step 2. Implement the user-defined callback @ref ble_ias_alert_level_write_callback() to listen to the write event of the Alert Level Characteristic.
 *  - Sample Code:
 *     @code
 *                void ble_ias_alert_level_write_callback(uint16_t conn_handle, uint8_t alert_level)
 *                {
 *                    if (conn_handle) {
 *                        // Save the alert level.
 *                    }
 *                }
 *     @endcode

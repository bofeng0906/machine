For an introduction to UART, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uart"> UART</a> in Wikipedia.|
 * |\b USB              | Universal Serial Bus. USB was designed to standardize the connection of computer peripherals (including keyboards, pointing devices, digital cameras, printers, portable media players, disk drives and network adapters) to personal computers, both to communicate and to supply electric power. It has become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles. USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial and parallel ports, as well as separate power chargers for portable devices.

 * @section PORT_SERVICE_Features_Chapter Supported features
 *
 * - <b> Supported Serial Port Service AT command format </b> \n
 *   The command format should start with "AT+EPORT=<OP>", and finish with "<\r><\n>" to
 *   mark the end of the AT command.
 *   The Serial Port Service module AT command's format is "AT+EPORT=<OP>[,<owner_name>,<device_id>,<param1>,<param2>]".
 *   - <b><OP> field description </b> \n
 *     <OP> field has an integer value, each value is described below. \n
 *     - 0: Display the port assignment for application or user, for example, "ATCI = 1" means the ATCI is using port 1. \n
 *     - 1: Set a specific port for a specific application or user. \n
 *     - 2: Switch old port to specific port for the specific application or user at runtime. \n
 *     - 3: Modify the settings of the devices in Serial Port Service. \n
 *     - 4: Show the settings of the devices in Serial Port Service. \n
 *   - <b><owner_name> field description </b> \n
 *     <owner_name> field has a string value for application name of Serial Port Service, details are shown below. \n
 *     - atci: ATCI application. \n
 *     - syslog: Syslog application. \n
 *   - <b><device_id> field description </b> \n
 *     <device_id> field has an integer value. For more details about each value, please refer to #serial_port_dev_t. \n
 *   - <b><param1> field description </b> \n
 *     <param1> field values are described below. \n
 *     - When <OP>=3 and <device_id>=0/1/2/3, it indicates baudrate of the UART port.\n
 *   - <b><param2> field description </b> \n
 *     <param2> field values are described below. \n
 *     - When <OP>=0, it indicates the port assignment of applications or users. \n

 *
 * @section Port_Service_Usage_Chapter How to use this module
 * - Step 1. Call #serial_port_open() to assign the callback function and open the port.
 * - Step 2. Call #serial_port_control() to read data or write data with a specific command.
 * - Step 3. Call #serial_port_close() to close the serial port if the Serial Port Service is no longer in use.
 * - Sample code
 * @code
 *    serial_port_status_t status;
 *    serial_port_read_data_t read_data;
 *    serial_port_write_data_t write_data;
 *    uint32_t g_serial_port_handle = 0;

 *    uint8_t buffer_len = 8;
 *    serial_port_open_para_t serial_port_open_para;
 *    serial_port_open_para.callback = user_callback;
 *    status = serial_port_open(port, &serial_port_open_para, &g_serial_port_handle);
 *    if (status != SERIAL_PORT_STATUS_OK)
 *        // Error handler
 *    // Read data
 *    read_data.buffer = (uint8_t*) buffer;
 *    read_data.size = buffer_len;
 *    status = serial_port_control(g_serial_port_handle, SERIAL_PORT_CMD_READ_DATA, (serial_port_ctrl_para_t*)&read_data);
 *    if (status != SERIAL_PORT_STATUS_OK)
 *        // Error handler
 *    // Write data
 *    write_data.data = buffer;
 *    write_data.size = buffer_len;
 *    status = serial_port_control(g_serial_port_handle, SERIAL_PORT_CMD_WRITE_DATA, (serial_port_ctrl_para_t*)&write_data);
 *    if (status != SERIAL_PORT_STATUS_OK)
 *        // Error handler
 *
 *    // Close the port if it's no longer in use

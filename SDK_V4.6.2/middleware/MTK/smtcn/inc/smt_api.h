 * This section introduces MediaTek Smart Connection APIs including details on how to use the APIs, enums, structures and functions.
 *
 * @section Smart_Connection_Usage_Chapter How to use these APIs
 *
 * - Connecting to the target AP with Smart Connection\n
 *  - Step 1. Define a #wifi_smart_connection_callback_t callback function to process a Smart Connection event.
 *  - Step 2. Call #wifi_smart_connection_init() to apply for required resources.
 * Note: The predefined callback, such as, the smtcn_evt_handler(), should be passed to the #wifi_smart_connection_init().
 *  - Step 3. Call #wifi_smart_connection_start() to start the Smart Connection.
 *  - Step 4. Call #wifi_smart_connection_get_result() to get the SSID and the password, when receiving #WIFI_SMART_CONNECTION_EVENT_INFO_COLLECTED event.
 *  - Step 5. Connect to the target AP.
 *  - Step 6: Call #wifi_smart_connection_stop() to exit the Smart Connection. Or call #wifi_smart_connection_deinit() if the connection is succesffuly established.
 *  - sample code:
 *    @code
 *      void smtcn_evt_handler(wifi_smart_connection_event_t event, void *data)
 *      {
 *          uint8_t passwd[WIFI_LENGTH_PASSPHRASE + 1] = {0}; 
 *          uint8_t ssid[WIFI_MAX_LENGTH_OF_SSID + 1] = {0};
 *          uint8_t ssid_len = 0;
 *          uint8_t passwd_len = 0;
 *   
 *          switch (event)
 *          {
 *              case WIFI_SMART_CONNECTION_EVENT_CHANNEL_LOCKED:
 *                  //Report the locked channel.
 *                  break;
 *              case WIFI_SMART_CONNECTION_EVENT_TIMEOUT:
 *                  //Report the timeout to the upper layers.
 *                  break;
 *              case WIFI_SMART_CONNECTION_EVENT_INFO_COLLECTED:
 *                  //Save the received information and connect to the target AP, and then call #wifi_smart_connection_deinit() to release the resources.
 *                  wifi_smart_connection_get_result(ssid, &ssid_len, passwd, &passwd_len, NULL, NULL);
 *                  mtk_scan_connect_ap(ssid, passwd);
 *                  wifi_smart_connection_deinit();
 *                  break;
 *          }
 *      }
 *
 *      int32_t mtk_smart_connect(void)
 *      {
 *          if(wifi_smart_connection_init(NULL, 0, smtcn_evt_handler) < 0){
 *              return -1;
 *          }
 *
 *          wifi_smart_connection_start(0);
 *          return 0;
 *     }
 *
 *     int32_t mtk_smart_stop(void)
 *     {
 *         wifi_smart_connection_stop();
 *         return 0;

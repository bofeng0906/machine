 * This document introduces MTK smart connection interfaces for upper applications.
 * It has wrapped the base interfaces of core.h, which supplies core functionality
 * of MTK elian protocol. MTK elian protocol is confidential and it doesn't
 * release its source code. The file smt_conn.c shows how to use these elian
 * APIs and WiFi APIs, such as switch channel, set rx filter, set raw packet
 * handler and so on.
 * You can replace MTK elian protocol and develop your own smart
 * config protocol easily.

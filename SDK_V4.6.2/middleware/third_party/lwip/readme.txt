                To enable debug log of LWIP module, please add "#define LWIP_DEBUG LWIP_DBG_ON" in
                project/mt76x7_hdk/apps/<project>/inc/lwipopts.h, after that, please redefine the
                log module in LWIP to LWIP_DBG_ON, e.g., "#define IP_DEBUG LWIP_DBG_ON".
                The default log type of LWIP is defined in lwip_log.c as ERROR type. You can modify
                the sources of lwip_log.c to other debug type, such as "log_create_module(lwip, PRINT_LEVEL_INFO)".

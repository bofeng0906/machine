 * Open source MQTT client implementation is part of Paho project aimed at new, existing, and emerging applications for Machine‑to‑Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT). For more details, please refer to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/paho"> Paho project </a>.
 * In this release, MediaTek has integrated Paho MQTT protocol with mbed TLS and lwIP. New APIs related to the network connectivity are also introduced in this section.
 * The MQTT add-on APIs follow the original Paho project coding style.
 * A reference example can be found under /project/mt7687_hdk/apps/mqtt_client folder.

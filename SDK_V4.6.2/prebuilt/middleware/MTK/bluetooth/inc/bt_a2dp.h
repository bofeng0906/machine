 * |\b SBC                        | The Low Complexity Subband Coding (SBC) is an audio subband codec specified by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) for the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP). SBC is a digital audio encoder and decoder used to transfer data to Bluetooth audio output devices like headphones or loudspeakers. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBC_(codec)">Wikipedia</a>.|
 * |\b AAC                        | Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is an audio coding standard for lossy digital audio compression. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding">Wikipedia</a>.|

 * |\b SEP                        | Stream End Point (SEP) is a concept to expose available Transport Services and AV capabilities of the Application in order to negotiate a stream. |
 * |\b SNK                        | Sink. A device is the SNK when it acts as a sink of a digital audio stream delivered from the SRC on the same piconet. |
 * |\b SRC                        | Source. A device is the SRC when it acts as a source of a digital audio stream that is delivered to the SNK of the piconet. |

 *
 * @section bt_a2dp_api_usage How to use this module
 *
 * - The A2DP confirmation/indication notifies the upper layer that the process has finished or an indication is received.
 *   BT_A2DP_XXX_CNF represents the events that a procedure has finished.
 *   BT_A2DP_XXX_IND represents the events that an indication has been received.
 * - The A2DP confirmation/indication structures provide related information to the upper layer.
 *   The data is obtained from the events parameter.
 *
 *  - 1. Mandatory, implement #bt_a2dp_get_init_params() to set the initial configuration (device role, SEP number, SEP detail, etc). This is a user-defined API, which is invoked when the Bluetooth is powered on. It should be implemented by the application.
 *   - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       bt_status_t bt_a2dp_get_init_params(bt_a2dp_init_params_t *params)
 *       {
 *           static bt_a2dp_codec_capability_t init_codec;
 *           // Fill codec infomation into init_codec.
 *
 *           params->codec_number = 1;
 *           params->codec_list = &init_codec;
 *
 *           return BT_STATUS_SUCCESS;
 *       }
 *    @endcode
 *  - 2. Mandatory, implement #bt_app_event_callback() to handle the A2DP events, such as 
 *           connect, disconnect, streaming start indication, media data received, etc.
 *   - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       void bt_app_event_callback(bt_msg_type_t msg_id, bt_status_t status, void *buff)
 *       {
 *           switch (msg_id)
 *           {
 *               case BT_A2DP_CONNECT_CNF:
 *               {
 *                   bt_a2dp_connect_cnf_t *params = (bt_a2dp_connect_cnf_t *)buff;
 *                   // Check connection result and save handle if connection is successful.
 *                   break;
 *               }
 *               case BT_A2DP_DISCONNECT_CNF:
 *               {
 *                   bt_a2dp_disconnect_cnf_t *params = (bt_a2dp_disconnect_cnf_t *)buff;
 *                   // Check disconnection result and clear the A2DP context.
 *                   break;
 *               }
 *               default:
 *                   break;
 *           }
 *       }
 *    @endcode
 *  - 3. Optional, initiate a connection to a remote device, as shown in the figure titled as "The A2DP connection establishment message sequence" in the Bluetooth developer's guide under the [sdk_root]/doc folder.
 *   - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       // A BT_A2DP_CONNECT_CNF event notifies the function bt_app_event_callback() once the device is connected.
 *       ret = bt_a2dp_connect(&a2dp_handle, address, role);
 *    @endcode
 *  - 4. Mandatory, similar to sink, handles the events in #bt_app_event_callback().
 *   - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       void bt_app_event_callback(bt_msg_type_t msg_id, bt_status_t status, void *buff)
 *       {
 *           switch (msg_id)
 *           {
 *               case BT_A2DP_START_STREAMING_IND:
 *               {
 *                   bt_a2dp_start_streaming_ind_t *params = (bt_a2dp_start_streaming_ind_t *)buff;
 *                   // Must accept the request by sending the response with either true or false.
 *                   bt_a2dp_start_streaming_response(params->handle, true);
 *                   // Open sink codec (initialize the audio driver).
 *                   handle = bt_codec_a2dp_open(callback, codec_a2dp);
 *                   break;
 *               }
 *               case BT_A2DP_SUSPEND_STREAMING_IND:
 *               {
 *                   bt_a2dp_suspend_streaming_ind_t *params = (bt_a2dp_suspend_streaming_ind_t *)buff;
 *                   // Must accept the request by sending the response with either true or false.
 *                   bt_a2dp_suspend_streaming_response(params->handle, true);
 *                   break;
 *               }
 *               case BT_A2DP_RECONFIGURE_IND:
 *               {
 *                   bt_a2dp_reconfigure_ind_t *params = (bt_a2dp_reconfigure_ind_t *)buff;
 *                   // Must accept the request by sending the response with either true or false.
 *                   bt_a2dp_reconfigure_response(params->handle, true);
 *                   break;
 *               }
 *               default:
 *                   break;
 *           }
 *       }
 *    @endcode
 *  - 5. Mandatory, handle media event and write data to audio driver using #bt_app_event_callback().
 *   - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       void bt_app_event_callback(bt_msg_type_t msg_id, bt_status_t status, void *buff)
 *       {
 *           switch (msg_id)
 *           {
 *               case BT_A2DP_STREAMING_RECEIVED_IND:
 *               {
 *                   bt_a2dp_streaming_received_ind_t *params = (bt_a2dp_streaming_received_ind_t *)buff;
 *                   // Hold the received data node to prevent the node from being released before it is consumed.
 *                   // Remember that bt_a2dp_release_media_data_node() must be called after the data node is consumed.
 *                   bt_a2dp_hold_media_data_node(params->data_node);
 *                   break;
 *               }
 *               default:
 *                   break;
 *           }
 *       }
 *    @endcode
 *  - 6. Optional, initiate the disconnection from a remote device, as shown in the figure titled as "The A2DP connection release message sequence" in the Bluetooth developer's guide under the [sdk_root]/doc folder.
 *   - Sample code:
 *    @code
 *       //  A BT_A2DP_DISCONNECT_CNF event notifies the function bt_app_event_callback() once the device is disconnected.
 *       ret = bt_a2dp_disconnect(handle);
 *    @endcode

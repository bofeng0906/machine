 * @section BP_ALG_Usage_Chapter How to use this library
 * Step 1: Call #bp_alg_init() to initialize blood pressure algorithm library. \n 
 * Step 2: Call #bp_alg_set_user_info() to set the user information. \n 
 * Step 3: Call #bp_alg_process_data() when the PPG data or ECG data is received. \n 
 * Step 4: Call #bp_alg_get_bp() to get the blood pressure value, after the PPG/ECG data has been processed by #bp_alg_process_data(). \n
 *
 *  - Sample code:
 *    @code 
 *
 * #include "bp_alg.h" 
 * #define BP_DATA_LEN   12800  // The input data length 
 * bp_alg_out_t bp_output; // The output structure for #bp_alg_get_bp().
 * int32_t bp_height;      // The user's height as an input to #bp_alg_set_user_info().
 * int32_t bp_weight;      // The user's weight as an input to #bp_alg_set_user_info(). 
 * int32_t bp_gender;      // The user's gender as an input to #bp_alg_set_user_info(). 
 * int32_t bp_age;         // The user's age as an input to #bp_alg_set_user_info(). 
 * int32_t bp_arm_len;     // The user's arm length as an input to #bp_alg_set_user_info(). 
 * void example(void)
 * {
 *   int32_t i;
 *   // Initialization
 *   bp_alg_init();
 *   // Set the user specific settings.
 *   bp_alg_set_user_info(bp_age, bp_gender, bp_height, bp_weight, bp_arm_len);
 *   for (i=0;i<BP_DATA_LEN;i++)
 *   {
 *     bp_alg_process_data(ecg_data[i], 0); // Input the ECG data for processing. 
 *     bp_alg_process_data(ppg_data[i], 1); // Input the PPG data for processing.

 * @section OHRM_Usage_Chapter How to use OHRM APIs
 * Step 1: Call #ohrm_init() to initialize the OHRM library. The input value should have the correct representation of 1 g-force data. The dynamic range of accelerometer should be set to +/-8g in oder to prevent signal saturation under heavy motion condition. \n
 * Step 2: Call #ohrm_process() when PPG data or motion data is received. \n 
 * Step 3: Call #ohrm_get_bpm() to get the heart rate BPM value, after the PPG data has been processed by #ohrm_process(). \n
 *
 *  - sample code:
 *    @code 
 *
 * ohrm_data_t param_ppg1;   // The input PPG data structure for #ohrm_process().
